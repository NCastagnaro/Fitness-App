# Fitness-App

This fitness app utilizes the Chart.js library, to represent the applicable nutritional information for the user. You first are to enter your calorie and water goals. Then, you can enter your meals with the corresponding macronutrient values. After you add all the meals, you can press any of the total buttons, and your values should be summed up correctly. You should now we able to see your total macronutrient count, as well as your remaining calories. The same principle applies for the water. As you add to the total, the water glass should fill up, until you reach your goal. 

Currently, the application utilizes node and mySQL on the backend. There is a user count at the bottom of the page, which updates the count in real time once the information is submitted. However, this will not be the case for public users, as the database is stored locally.
